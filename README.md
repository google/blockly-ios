**The blockly-ios project is _no longer actively developed_ by the
Google Blockly team. We will continue to review and accept pull requests.
If you are looking to create a new Blockly-based app, we recommend using
the [web version](http://github.com/google/blockly) in a WebView.  We
have also create an
[XCode demonstration project](https://github.com/google/blockly/tree/develop/demos/mobile/ios)
that does exactly this.**

# Blockly for iOS

[Blockly][1] is a library for building drag-and-drop visual editors for
JavaScript, Python, Lua, and several other programming languages.

Blockly for iOS is similar to its web counterpart in terms of API, but is:

- Optimized for native iOS performance and easier integration in iOS apps
- Written in Swift, with backwards compatibility for Objective-C projects
- Designed with better touch support, such as custom input controls and
multi-touch

Here is a demo of using Blockly for iOS to program a "turtle":

# Features

Blockly for iOS includes:

- All major features available in Blockly for [Web][2] and [Android][3]
- Multi-touch support (currently only on iOS)
- Block animations (currently only on iOS)

The Blockly team is actively working on achieving feature parity across
all three platforms to support cross-platform development.
